# Autumn 2024 UW Ecoseminar on open and reproducible science practices

We’ll use the [Openscapes lesson series](https://openscapes.github.io/series/), which is an open data science mentorship program aiming to make science more efficient, collaborative, inclusive, and kind. We’ll work as a community of practice to share strategies and develop or refine science practices for individuals and research groups. The seminar will cover GitHub version control, data, and coding strategies. Please bring a laptop if possible for hands on activities. If there’s interest, we may spend some time exploring R Shiny for creating interactive data visualizations, building off a previous Ecoseminar on [R Shiny](https://github.com/ecoseminar).
